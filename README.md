This is Jordan and Tim collaborating on a script tool!

## 4/12 notes
- Review Jim's script
- Talked through Github Online v Desktop
- We want to create a custom geoprocessing tool (python toolbos OR python script tool, tbd later)
- This script will:
    - Start small. This means, write a script (at first) that allows for:
    - 1 input dataset
    - Adds standard Esri disclaimer, which changes whether it's MOOC or non-MOOC.
- [] Clean up and adapt Jim's script
